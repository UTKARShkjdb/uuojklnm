  <div class="u-clearfix u-sheet u-block-e074-2"><h1 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-palette-2-base u-block-e074-3">The Annunaki</h1><h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-block-e074-4">The Sumerian civilization emerged in Mesopotamia around 4500 B.C. Over time, it was responsible for building large cities and creating the first system of writing known as cuneiform writing, which was written on clay tablets during archeological excavations in 1849. In Iraq, 14 clay tablets with Sumerian writings were found. The translation of the texts revealed one of the most fantastic stories of all time- the story of the Anunnaki gods.<br>According to the Sumerian manuscripts, there is a planet at the ends of the solar system called Nibiru. Every three thousand six hundred years, it enters an orbit close to the planet Earth. Nibiru was the home planet of the Anunnaki, who were experiencing difficulties because the climate and atmosphere of the planets were changing rapidly, making it difficult to produce food and therefore to survive. It was necessary to use advanced methods of technology, alchemy and magic to reverse this situation. To do so, a large amount of gold was needed, since this metal has purifying properties capable of resisting even cosmic radiation.<br>However, gold was a rare resource in Nibiru, and without other alternatives, the Anunnaki used their advanced technology and sent ships into space in search of the precious golden metal. After a long and tiring search, they arrived on planet Earth about 445000 years ago, where they were the first astronauts to cross space and colonize another planet. The planet Earth was inhabited only by wild animals such as Mammoths, Zebra, Tigers and some apes. The Annunaki settled in what was to be Mesopotamia and built a wonderful city called Eridu.<br>In this city, there was a splendid garden full of fruit, trees and animals. The garden created by the Anunnaki was named Eden and was the favorite place of the astronaut gods. Shortly after gold extraction began in underground mines; to do the heavy tasks they brought with them slaves from another alien race, the Igigi. After years of forced labor and humiliation, the Igigi rebelled against the Anunnaki, giving rise to the first war on Earth. The Igigi were defeated and decimated.<br>&nbsp;Annunaki need new workers. Their solution was to create a new race of intelligent beings able to work but more harmless than the Igigi. The Annunaki combined their genes with the ancestors of human beings creating a hybrid and submissive race at their command. This genetic fusion did not go very well at first. Strange beings came to life like the Nephilim Giants, which, although extraordinarily strong, were devoid of intelligence and self-control. The first man to emerge from this successful genetic combination was named Adamou.<br>Compared to human beings, the Annunaki were incredibly tall and strong, and their weapons were more than enough to control another possible rebellion. Over time, humans developed the ability to speak and learnt from the Annunaki to take care of plantations and build houses made of clay and stone. The Annunaki came to like human beings. They even allowed them to live in their city and attend the sacred garden, but gave explicit orders not to reproduce excessively.<br>Against the will of the gods, human beings began to procreate quickly, which caused overpopulation in the city. Many people were expelled from Eden and Eridu and condemned to live in exile in wildlands. After a few millennia, the planet Nibiru approached the earth again. Nibiru's gravitational field was so strong that it adversely affected the Earth's natural conditions. There was an increase in the temperature of the planet, and the glaciers melted rapidly, raising the level of the oceans and causing constant rain. A great flood ravaged the earth and the city of Eridu was doomed to submerge.<br>To save their creation, the Anunnaki created large boats that floated for days to normal water level. In this part, it is not clear whether the boats floated on the water or whether the boats were ships hovering in the sky. After their city was destroyed, the Anunnaki decided to return to Nibiru, but before they left, they gave human beings knowledge of architecture, mathematics, music and writing. They also taught them how to establish a monarchy system where some leaders who kept the bloodline inherited from the Anunnaki pure had the right to command others. They also ordered the construction of temples known as Ziggurats aligned with the constellations. These would one day guide the Anunnaki back to Earth.&nbsp;</h3></div>
