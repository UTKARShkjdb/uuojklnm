  <div class="u-clearfix u-sheet u-block-6b98-2"><h1 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-palette-2-base u-block-6b98-3">​Evidence-1</h1><h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-block-6b98-4">The American Department of Defense confirms that videos and photos of an unidentified flying object (UFO) taken by the American navy and air force are real.&nbsp;It all started on March 4th, 2019Just a few hundred miles off the northeast coast of the United States. The pilots are on high alert,&nbsp; not just because of their training mission, but because since at least as far back as&nbsp; 2014 pilots have been reporting strange phenomena over the airspace known simply as&nbsp; W-72.&nbsp;Located just off the coasts of southern Virginia and North Carolina.&nbsp; Flying at several thousand feet, the F-18 weapons system officer spots three objects he believes are drones. Flying in for a closer look, he's startled to discover that these objects are like nothing he's ever seen before. At 2:44 PM Eastern time, the F-18's WSO&nbsp; &nbsp;takes out his smartphone and snaps a photo of a spherical object flying close to his aircraft. At 3:02, the plane runs across a second mysterious object, this time dubbed 'the acorn'. Then, twelve minutes after contact with the second UFO,&nbsp; the F-18 comes across yet a third object, this time nicknamed 'the blimp'.&nbsp;The photos are submitted to the newly formed Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force and remain classified until two of them are leaked to the public.&nbsp;The photo of 'the sphere' however remains classified until it too was leaked to the public only recently. Perhaps most shocking of all though is that after decades of silence on the UFO matter, the Department of Defense is quick to admit that the photographs are real.&nbsp;Four months later- the Pacific Coast. Destroyers USS Kidd,&nbsp; USS Rafael Peralta and USS John Finn are out on exercises a hundred miles off the LA coast.&nbsp; In order to prevent being snooped on by curious civilians and foreign intelligence services,&nbsp; the destroyers are operating under strict radio silence.&nbsp;Suddenly,&nbsp; at 10 pm a lookout on the USS Kidd spots what he identifies as two drones approaching the ship.&nbsp; Ten minutes later, both the USS Rafael Peralta and USS John Finn report their own sightings.As the ships continue on their course, the drones seem drawn to the USS Kidd,&nbsp; and even match its speed . One drone moves in close enough to hover over the helicopter pad briefly then return to the formation.&nbsp;After 90 minutes the drones speed off,&nbsp; unfortunately, none of the ships are able to determine where the drones departed too.The next night the drones would return.The drones once more follow the warships, and out of desperation one of the destroyers radios a nearby Carnival cruise liner and asks for visual confirmation of the drones. The cruise liner confirms that they too can see four or five drones following the destroyers around,&nbsp; and convince them that the drones are not being flown by any of their passengers.&nbsp;It was even impossible, as the drones linger for three hours,&nbsp; well past the flight time of any civilian drone of similar size. Once more the drones disappear, unable to be tracked to wherever their destination was.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 25th and 30th of July, more drones fly around the navy destroyers. One of these incidents was documented on camera, and the footage was not just released to the public but confirmed as authentic by the Pentagon. The Pentagon gave no further details on this matter but what. We do know about this latest leaked video is that it was shot on the&nbsp; USS Russel using night vision equipment and submitted&nbsp; to the Unidentified Aerial&nbsp; Phenomenon congressional task force, where it was subsequently leaked to the public just this year.&nbsp;What was leaked to the public includes several glowing orbs over the USS Russel,&nbsp; followed by a pyramid-shaped UFO that seems to flash with lights as it silently glides overhead.&nbsp; What it was remains unknown.</h3></div>
